        Paul Gauguin was a French Post-Impressionist
        artist. Unappreciated until after his death,
        Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental
        use of color and Synthetist style that were
        distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end
        of his life, he spent ten years in French
        Polynesia. The paintings from this time
        depict people or landscapes from that region.
